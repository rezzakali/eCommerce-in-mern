This is a complete full stack project where I'm trying to make a simple e-commerce website using MongoDB,Express,React,Node.js. In this project I use Chakra-ui for designing and responsive and there is a awesome feature dark and white mode , and also I'm trying to add authentication using jsonwebtoken (jwt) and for hashing user password i used bcrypt which is my favourite ,where user can easily signin with Google and Github, I'm trying to validate user information like email and password and for showing this type of error or success message i used toast which is provided by the chakra-ui and many more .thanks
